<h2>About Olivia</h2>

<body>
	<p>A passionate and energetic individual, I was drawn to working with public audiences within arts institutions almost immediately after beginning my studies. I pursued visitor facing positions at public art institutions, museums and UQ student societies, whilst simultaneously completing a Bachelor of Arts (Honours Class I) (Art History). I have 4+ years of experience working in visitor engagement roles, arts marketing, program development and art historical research. I have extensive knowledge of art history, and am passionate about connecting with audiences in inquiry and collaborative learning through engaging programming..</p>

<p>My recent projects include co-producing a thirteen part public program series for Outer Space Brisbane, comprising of professional development training and education aimed at emerging artists and artworkers.</p>

<p>Additionally, I freelance as an arts writer and educator. As well as offering services as a private tutor, specialising in English, History, Visual Art, Film & Media Studies and tertiary education preparation.</p>

<p>My previous experience includes working with University of Queensland Art Museum, implementing their Cultural Mediation engagement strategy, at Adderton: house & heart of mercy, the Insitute of Modern Art, the Brisbane Portrait Prize and with the University of Queensland's Student Futures team.</p>
