<h3>About the Art</h3>
<p>Imogen Corbett is a Brisbane based oil painter, whose work combines hyper realistic detail with surreal, fantasy compositions. Her subject matter engages with the traditions of portraiture, still life and landscapes, which is then destabilized through surrealism. She uses recurring motifs such as young and older models, skulls, smoke and decaying fruit, as reminders of our mortality. Her objective is to make contemporary vanitas paintings which explore life, death and their often overlooked connection to one another.</p>
