	<h1>Cats and Cars!</h1>
	<p>This fancy new website is going show off how fabulous Josh Argle's cats and Mercedes cars are!</p>
	<h2>Classy Cats</h2>
	<p>The Artist, Joshua Argle, aka Shag, was a prolific producer of contemporary art in the late 1950's to 60's. His images featured many stylised forms including cats, tikis (tribal figures), aeroplanes, scooters, cocktail drinks, lamps and buildings. Each art piece is very reflective of the era and showcased the newer contemporary trends of the time.  eg. air travel was something new and opening to the general public .</p>

	<h3>Pink Cars</h3>
	<p>I am restoring a Mercedes Benz 170S which was an important car for Mercedes as it was the first car that they were able to bring inot production after the end of World War II. If my daughter had her way she would have me spray paint it pink. </p>
